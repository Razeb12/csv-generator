CSV File Processing Manual

To process CSV files and generate an output CSV file, please follow these steps:

Ensure that all the CSV files you want to process are located in the root directory of the script.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the cd command. For example:

Run the script using the Node.js runtime by executing the following command:
```node script.js
```

Wait for the script to process the CSV files and generate the output CSV file. The script will provide feedback in the terminal, indicating the successful creation of the output file.

Once the script has finished executing, you can find the generated output CSV file in the same directory as the script. The output CSV file will be named output.csv.

Please note the following:

Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions.

Only CSV files placed in the root directory of the script will be processed. Subdirectories or files with unsupported formats will be ignored.

The script will automatically process both XLS and CSV files. You don't need to specify any file extensions or make any modifications to the script.

The generated output CSV file will contain the processed data from all the CSV files in the root directory. Each CSV file will be represented as a row in the output file, with the appropriate columns and tab names.

By following these steps, you can easily process multiple CSV files and generate an output CSV file using the provided script.
